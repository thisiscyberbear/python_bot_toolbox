# Python-Bot-Toolbox

python_bot_toolbox is a toolbox which contains several tools to create python bot scripts. This project is still in progress and will grow more.
The toolbox will contain functions to extract image, video, text and audio information from the screen to interact with them.  

Sooner or later it is planned to make the project available via pip.

You may need to install dependencies depending on your OS (see requirements.txt)
